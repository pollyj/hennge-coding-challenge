Improvements:
1) I would add a compare function that allows the user to select up to X number of emails to compare. Upon selection, the user would be taken to a new page where each of the emails selected would be displayed one after the other for easy viewing.

2) Customization options
   - Users can select to show all recipient emails at one time (instead of the "+1" badge)
   - Users can color code emails to help them organize

3) Ability to sort emails into categories and then view by category. I imagine it would probably be very useful to be able to 'tag' emails if you are auditing a large amount. There could be a "star" feature for emails that need to be checked more carefully later, etc.
